To restore this repository and working set:

1. Make sure your Subversion installation is set to be in c:\svn
2. Unzip the contents of r1_Final.zip to c:\svn.  Note, make sure the contents of the r1 folder in the zip ends up in the r1 folder under c:\svn
3. Unzip the contents of the r1-p1_Finished.zip to c:\.  Again, make sure the contents of the r1-p1 folder (i.e. the branches, tags and trunk directory) end up in c:\r1-p1

Once you do this you can either use the command line in the c:\r1-p1 folder to run 'svn log' to see the history of the repository or use the TortoiseSVN tools to browse the repository in the c:\r1-p1 directory.
